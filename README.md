# off2txt

Extracts ASCII/Unicode text from Office files to separate files.

Useful if you have a document containing two languages (e.g. English and Chinese) and you want to separate the languages into text files for further processing and analysis. 

Supports Open XML file formats. That is, docx, pptx, and xlsx.

Word and PowerPoint files are extracted to text files. 
Excel files are extracted to CSV files, columns are preserved.

Can be used to make a CSV file from Excel without opening Excel.

## Examples

### Extract ASCII and Unicode Text From a Word Document

```shell
$ off2txt -s word.docx
```

The above will make two files: word-ascii.txt and word-unicode.txt

### Extract ASCII and Unicode Text From an Excel Document

```shell
$ off2txt -s excel.xlsx
```

The above will make two files: excel-ascii.csv and excel-unicode.csv

## Notes

If an extracted file would be empty, it is not created.

Excel is different. Columns are preserved. So may get a CSV file of empty columns. Cells are put in the extracted ASCII file if they containt ASCII only otherwise they are streamed to the Unicode file.

## Installation

```shell
pip install off2txt
```
